# TradeAway

## Introduction

TradeAway is an application designed to assist users in selling used items or buying them from other users. This application created primarily in Java focuses on creating an user-friendly trading environment.

## Features

### User Profiles

Each user needs to create a profile in order to do anything except browsing. TradeAway profile consists of an username, e-mail, phone number, profile picture and user's full name. Profiles can be created without some of the details, but are limited. Limited accounts are permitted to see seller's e-mail and phone number, as well as leaving reviews on seller's profile (after the purchase is completed).

In order to create a listing, users must fully complete their profile information.

### Ratings

Each seller has a rating ranging between 1.0 and 5.0. We highly recommend leaving a review on the seller's profile after purchase, to help create a safer shopping environment.
Reviews must contain a rating, but the reason is optional.

### Listings

Listings are divided in a plethora of categories and subcategories, all of which users can individually browse. Some of the (sub)categories have additional filters to help users find exactly what they are looking for.

Each listing has requirements:
  - at least one picture
  - price
  - listing title
  - listing description
  - quantity

If quantity is larger than one, listing itself has user reviews section, where buyers can rate the product itself, apart from rating the seller on their profile.

### Sponspored Ads

To display a select listing above others in the same (sub)category / search results, seller is able to purchase a sponsoring for their listing, at a price based on the duration of said sponsoring.

### Search Bar

Typing in a search bar will filter out all the listing in the same (sub)category according to their title. If a search is done outside of a category, recommended categories will show up, based on the quantity of results falling within the same categories.
