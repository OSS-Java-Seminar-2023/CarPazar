## Introduction

TradeAway is an application designed to assist users in selling used items or buying them from other users. This application created primarily in Java focuses on creating an user-friendly trading environment.

## Features

### User Profiles

Each user needs to create a profile in order to do anything except browsing. TradeAway profile consists of an username, e-mail, phone number, profile picture and user's full name. Profiles can be created without some of the details, but are limited. Limited accounts are permitted to see seller's e-mail and phone number, as well as leaving reviews on seller's profile (after the purchase is completed).

In order to create a listing, users must fully complete their profile information.

### Premium Profile

Premium profiles enjoy increased exposure for their listings, leading to faster sales and a higher volume of potential buyers.
Ideal for sellers seeking maximum visibility for their items, such as power sellers, businesses, or individuals with a large inventory of items to sell.
Premium profiles help users gain a competitive edge and stand out in a crowded marketplace, ensuring their listings are seen by more users.

Premium profiles may be acquired through the accumulation of positive reviews by consistently offering excellent service or by reviewing a lot of items that you've bought. This rewards sellers for providing exceptional service and maintaining a high level of trust among the TradeAway community.

### Premium Listing

Are you in a hurry to sell an item, but don't have a Premium Profile? Don't worry! Our Premium Listing feature is here to the rescue. It provides a one-time advertisement that will undoubtedly skyrocket your item's exposure and visibility within the TradeAway community.
With a Premium Listing, your item will be front and center, catching the eye of potential buyers instantly. No more waiting in line – your item takes the lead!

### Ratings

Each seller has a rating ranging between 1.0 and 5.0. We highly recommend leaving a review on the seller's profile after purchase, to help create a safer shopping environment.
Reviews must contain a rating, but the reason is optional. As previously mentioned, actively engaging in reviews can potentially elevate your standard profile to a premium one if you currently don't have a premium profile.

### Listings

Listings are divided in a plethora of categories and subcategories, all of which users can individually browse. Some of the (sub)categories have additional filters to help users find exactly what they are looking for.

Each listing has requirements:
  - at least one picture
  - price
  - listing title
  - listing description
  - quantity

//If quantity is larger than one, listing itself has user reviews section, where buyers can rate the product itself, apart from rating the seller on their profile. (optional)

### Search Bar

Typing in a search bar will filter out all the listing in the same (sub)category according to their title. If a search is done outside of a category, recommended categories will show up, based on the quantity of results falling within the same categories.

### Wishlist

Your TradeAway Wishlist is like your secret shopping helper. Whether you are looking for ideas, keeping track of gift possibilities, or just staying organized with your interests, our Wishlist makes online shopping more fun and simple.

### Favourite Categories

TradeAway's Favorite Categories feature is your key to a more personalized and convenient shopping experience. We understand that your interests are diverse, and that's why we've created this feature to help you easily explore the things you love most on our platform. Users can filter their categories of interest and turn on notifications if they want to receive updates about new listings, special promotions, or price changes within those selected categories.

### Forum

Here, you can connect with a passionate community of users who might just have what you're looking for, even if they weren't initially planning to sell it.
