## Introduction

CarPazar is an application designed to assist users in selling and buying cars from other users. This application, created primarily in Java, focuses on creating a user-friendly environment for trading cars.


## Features

### User Profiles

Each user needs to create a profile in order to do anything except browsing. CarPazar profiles consist of a username, email, phone number, user's full name and other details. Profiles are required in order to gain trust within CarPazar community.

In order to create a car listing, users must fully complete their profile information.


### Premium Profile

Premium profiles enjoy increased exposure for their car listings, leading to faster sales and a higher volume of potential buyers. This is ideal for sellers seeking maximum visibility for their cars, such as power sellers, dealerships, or individuals with a large inventory of cars to sell. Premium profiles help users gain a competitive edge and stand out in a crowded marketplace, ensuring their car listings are seen by more users.


### Premium Listing

Are you in a hurry to sell a car but don't have a Premium Profile? Don't worry! Our Premium Car Listing feature is here to the rescue. It provides a one-time advertisement that will undoubtedly skyrocket your car's exposure and visibility within the CarPazar community. With a Premium Car Listing, your car will be front and center, catching the eye of potential buyers instantly.


### Listings

Listings are divided into a variety of categories and subcategories, all of which users can individually browse. Some of the (sub)categories have additional filters to help users find exactly what they are looking for.


Each car listing has specific requirements:
  - At least one picture
  - Price
  - Listing title
  - Listing description
  - Key details about the car
  - Contact information of the seller
  - Mileage, year, make, model of the car
  - Other additional details/equipment


### Search Bar

Using the search bar will filter out all the car listings in the same (sub)category based on their titles.


### Chat

Users can message car sellers through our application and ask any questions about listings they are interested in!
