## Introduction

CarPazar is an application designed to assist users in selling and buying cars from other users. This application, created primarily in Java, focuses on creating a user-friendly environment for trading cars.


## Features

### User Profiles

Each user needs to create a profile in order to do anything except browsing. CarPazar profiles consist of a username, email, phone number, profile picture, and the user's full name. Profiles can be created without some of these details, but limited profiles have restricted functionality. Limited accounts are permitted to see seller's contact information and leave reviews on the seller's profile.

In order to create a car listing, users must fully complete their profile information.


### Premium Profile

Premium profiles enjoy increased exposure for their car listings, leading to faster sales and a higher volume of potential buyers. This is ideal for sellers seeking maximum visibility for their cars, such as power sellers, dealerships, or individuals with a large inventory of cars to sell. Premium profiles help users gain a competitive edge and stand out in a crowded marketplace, ensuring their car listings are seen by more users.

Premium profiles may be acquired through the accumulation of positive reviews by consistently offering excellent service or by reviewing a significant number of cars that you've bought. This rewards sellers for providing exceptional service and maintaining a high level of trust within the CarPazar community.


### Premium Listing

Are you in a hurry to sell a car but don't have a Premium Profile? Don't worry! Our Premium Car Listing feature is here to the rescue. It provides a one-time advertisement that will undoubtedly skyrocket your car's exposure and visibility within the CarPazar community. With a Premium Car Listing, your car will be front and center, catching the eye of potential buyers instantly.


### Ratings

Each seller has a rating ranging between 1.0 and 5.0. We highly recommend leaving a review on the seller's profile after a car purchase to help create a safer and more trustworthy trading environment. Reviews must contain a rating, but the reason is optional. As mentioned earlier, actively engaging in reviews can potentially elevate your standard profile to a premium one if you currently don't have a premium profile.


### Listings

Listings are divided into a variety of categories and subcategories, all of which users can individually browse. Some of the (sub)categories have additional filters to help users find exactly what they are looking for.


Each car listing has specific requirements:
  - At least one picture
  - Price
  - Listing title
  - Listing description
  - Key details about the car
  - Contact information of the seller
  - Mileage, year, make, and model of the car


### Search Bar

Using the search bar will filter out all the car listings in the same (sub)category based on their titles. If a search is done outside of a category, recommended categories will show up, based on the quantity of results within those categories.


### Wishlist

Your CarPazar Wishlist is like your secret car shopping helper. Whether you are looking for ideas, keeping track of your dream cars, or just staying organized with your car interests, our Wishlist makes online car shopping more fun and simple.


### Favourite Categories

CarPazar's Favorite Car Categories feature is your key to a more personalized and convenient car shopping experience. We understand that your car interests are diverse, and that's why we've created this feature to help you easily explore the cars you love most on our platform. Users can filter their categories of interest and turn on notifications if they want to receive updates about new car listings, special promotions, or price changes within those selected categories.


### Forum

Are you on the hunt for something truly unique or specific that you can't seem to find on our site? The CarPazar Forum is your ultimate destination. Here, you can connect with a passionate community of users who might just have the car you're looking for, even if they weren't initially planning to sell it.

Find the Unfindable: The Forum is your secret treasure for those elusive cars that might not appear in regular listings. Whether it's a rare collectible, a vintage car, or a niche model, the Forum is where it might just pop up.

Engage with Like-minded Enthusiasts: Join conversations, discussions, and threads about your car interests. Connect with fellow car enthusiasts who share your passions and tap into their knowledge and networks.
